# task-manager
The code was written in vanilla javascript, as a training and education.
The task manager uses the drag and drop mechanic to indicate the importance of the task, the delete and marking buttons, as well as the delete button for all marked tasks. Also added a dark theme, displaying the date and saving data and changes to the local storage.
